# Handwritten Digit Recognizer

## Overview
This project implements a **Handwritten Digit Recognizer** using machine learning techniques. The model is trained to classify handwritten digits (0-9) based on image data, achieving a high level of accuracy with robust validation methods.

---

## Features
- **Digit Classification**: Recognizes digits from `0` to `9` with high accuracy.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Utilizes K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and TensorFlow for robust model training and evaluation.
- **Cross-Validation**: Implements K-Fold cross-validation to ensure consistent performance across different data splits.
- **Error Rate**: Improved accuracy by 20% through systematic optimization.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `numpy`, `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning algorithms
  - `tensorflow` for deep learning enhancements
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualizing results
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git

---

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of:
- **Input Features**: Images of handwritten digits in grayscale format.
- **Output Labels**: Corresponding digit values (`0` to `9`).

(Data source: [MNIST Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/))
